---

I obtained my bachelors degree from the Department of Electonic and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, where I ranked 5th among 117 students. I completed my research project titled “Physical Layer Security for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Two–Way Communications” under the supervision of Dr. Tharaka Samarasinghe, Dr. Kasun Hemachandra, Dr. Saman Atapattu and Prof. Jamie Evans. My final year project was based on using machine learning for Non-intrusive Load Monitoring to reduce the houselhold electricity wastage.

I was a visiting student in Augmented Human Lab, University of Auckaland, New Zealand, where I wroked under the supervision of Prof. Suranga Nanayakkara. There, I contributed to two resarch projects mainly based on machine learning and electromagnetism.
