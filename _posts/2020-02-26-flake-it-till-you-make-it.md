title: My Interests
---

I have a strong affinity towards mathematics and I am highly inspired by its applications in real-world scenarios. Due to my passion towards applied statistics and probability, I am keen on contributing to the development of theoretical frameworks which lie in the intersection of statistical machine learning, statistical signal processing, communications and information theory. I also have a passion towards discrete mathematics, specifically number theory and combinatorics.
